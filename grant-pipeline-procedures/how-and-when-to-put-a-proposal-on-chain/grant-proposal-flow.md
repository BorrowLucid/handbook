# Grant Proposal Flow

### MolochDAO Grants are processed three times per year, April-May, August-September and December-January.  It is a two month process that begins on the first day of the first month and ends on the twentieth day of the second month.  The following schedule can be applied to any of the trianual grant rounds.

**First day of the First Month: Exploration Phase - Applications are open!**

* Application should be posted on the Discourse forum to facilitate public debate
* Internal member conversation can happen in the dedicated #proposal-discussion Discord channel.
* ReallyBoringGuild (RBG) will encourage MolochDAO members to submit applications on the forum and to scrutinize other applications posted there.
* **RBG will not be submitting proposals on behalf of DAO members.**

**15th day of the First Month: Scrutiny Phase - Criticize!**

* Members are encouraged to provide feedback on their preferred proposals in the Discourse forum (public) and #proposal-discussion Discord channel. RBG will relay this information to the projects to help strengthen their proposal and schedule townhall meetings with the projects if desired.
* RBG will create polls for the strongest proposals to secure sentiment from members. This will occur in the #proposal-discussion Discord channel.
* Weak or undesireable projects will be removed from consideration at this time. “Bad fit” projects will be notified.

**28th day of the First Month: Submission Phase - Proposals Go On-Chain!**

* Projects that have gathered positive sentiment from the DAO will be invited to submit their proposal on-chain through the [DAOhaus portal](https://app.daohaus.club/dao/0x1/0x519f9662798c2e07fbd5b30c1445602320c5cf5b/proposals). Note: v2 Moloch DAOs allow anyone to submit a proposal, not restricted to members. 12 proposals can be submitted per day. **Proposals should not be sponsored at this time.**

**First Day of the Second Month: Deadline for Submitting Proposals**

**First Week of the Second Month: Sponsorship and Voting Phase**

* DAO members that have expressed interest in championing specific projects will be reminded by RBG to sponsor the proposal at a **sponsorship price of 1 WETH.** _There is no processing reward on the v2 DAO,_ so **100% of these funds will be returned after the grace period** and gas fees will be reimbursed from the RBG budget. (Please keep your txn records!)
* Sponsorship will occur at a **MolochDAO member meeting (aka sponsorship party!) scheduled for the second Monday of the second month** to ensure they are opened to voting at the same time.
* The voting period is 7 days.

**15th day of the Second Month: Results and Grace Period**

* All voting should be complete at this time, with some latency due to staggered sponsorship. We will know the results of proposals.
* RBG will notify MolochDAO members of their opportunity to Ragequit during the 7 day grace period.
* RBG will notify successfull applicants of their success and begin the onboarding process!

**Onboarding Process**

* Blast the grant announcements on MolochDAO social channels! Twitter, blog post on website, etc.
* Extend new MolochDAO handbook
* Invite to MolochDAO Discord server and update role to “member”
* Invite to reoccuring DAO meetings: RBG ops sync, Friday cocktail hour
* Invite to an orientation meeting for new grantees: **Second Friday of the Second Month**
* Encourage them to keep some of their shares and continue contributing to MolochDAO!

**20th day of the Second Month: Proposals are Processed! End of the Pipeline**

* RBG (or any DAO member) can process proposals to make the results official.
