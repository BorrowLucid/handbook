# Proposal Process

**What do we fund?**

*

**What do we not fund?**

*

**How much funding is usually available?**

*

**How do we support the projects we give grants to?**

*

**Where can I read more about previous grants?**

*

**What is the process of getting funding?**

* Post your idea on the forums to get initial feedback from other community members; tweet at us, message us etc. We usually chat and provide very quick feedback in regards to whether the project would be in the scope of funding.
* We’ll usually reach out to jump on a video call with you and within 2-3 days within the call determine if your project is a good fit.
* Submit a proposal on-chain through the DAOHaus platform
* If you get a strong yes signal from us, we’ll likely provide feedback and also have additional feedback for the project before we commit to a grant.
